Unplugged
=========

A simple iOS app that reminds you to unplug your charger when your iOS device stops charging.

I've tested this on iPhone and iPad. Throwing this up on GitHub as I'm sure Apple won't accept it to the App Store due to the way it keeps the app running in the background.

Would love to see others contribute.

Thanks!
